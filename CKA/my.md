Collaborated with networking, VPC Service Controls, and security teams to design an isolated VPC architecture based on Zero Trust principles, improving network segmentation and access control.
Developed a Go-based service using the Cobra CLI for GCP Cloud Build pipelines to automate application metadata processing, standardizing and streamlining onboarding workflows for application teams.
Created a Cloud Build Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipeline using Terraform with Styra policy checks to prevent infrastructure misconfigurations and security violations.
Built a Python service to automate and accelerate Tekton CI/CD onboarding for new projects, improving efficiency and reducing manual effort for application teams.
Implemented Argo CD for GitOps-based continuous delivery to OpenShift, enabling automated, declarative deployments with robust rollback capabilities.

Led testing of various GCP services (Apigee, CloudSQL, Load Balancers, Compute Engine, Cloud Run, DataProc, Firestore) within an isolated VPC aligned with a Zero Trust security posture.

Deployed commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Docker applications in a Zero Trust OpenShift cluster, integrating ActiveMQ messaging, Astronomer Airflow for ETL orchestration, and SSO for secure workflows.
Implemented mandatory tagging and labeling within Terraform modules for GCP resources, ensuring governance, immutable tags, and cost tracking across teams.

Enhanced Tekton and Cloud Build pipelines with quality gates, implementing "break the deployment/break build on error" logic on environment promotion failures.

Designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines integrating DevSecOps tools (SonarQube, Cycode, Checkmarx, FOSSA, 42Crunch) to automate secure API publishing on Apigee.Set up monitoring/logging solutions using Dynatrace, Prometheus, Thanos, Grafana; developed custom log sink operators and DB log exports for apps.
